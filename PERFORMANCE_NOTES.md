# Performance Optimization for Large Files

## File Size Increases

VideoCraft now supports significantly larger files:
- **Video Files**: Up to 2GB (increased from 200MB - 10x improvement)
- **Script Files**: Up to 500KB (increased from 100KB - 5x improvement)  
- **Audio Files**: Up to 500MB (increased from 100MB - 5x improvement)

## Performance Considerations

### For Large Video Files (>500MB):
1. **Processing Time**: Large files will take longer to process
2. **Memory Usage**: Ensure you have sufficient RAM (recommended: 8GB+)
3. **Storage Space**: Temporary files may require additional disk space
4. **Chunk Processing**: The system automatically processes large files in chunks

### Optimization Tips:
1. **Close Other Applications**: Free up system resources before processing
2. **Use SSD Storage**: Faster disk I/O improves processing speed
3. **Internet Connection**: Some AI models are downloaded on first use
4. **Patience**: Large files may take 5-15 minutes to process

### Recommended System Requirements:
- **RAM**: 8GB minimum, 16GB recommended
- **Storage**: 10GB free space for temporary files
- **CPU**: Multi-core processor (4+ cores recommended)
- **GPU**: Optional but improves AI model performance

### Troubleshooting Large Files:
- If processing fails, try reducing video resolution
- Ensure stable internet connection for model downloads
- Clear cache if running out of disk space
- Consider splitting very large videos into smaller segments
