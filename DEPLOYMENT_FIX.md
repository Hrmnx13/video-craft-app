# Streamlit Cloud Deployment Fix Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **TensorFlow/tf-keras Dependency Conflict**
- **Problem**: tf-keras==2.20.0 was yanked, causing infinite dependency resolution loop
- **Solution**: Removed tf-keras and tensorflow from requirements (not needed for core functionality)

### 2. **Python Version Compatibility** 
- **Problem**: Python 3.13.5 doesn't have wheels for many packages
- **Solution**: Added `runtime.txt` specifying Python 3.11.9

### 3. **WhisperX Compatibility**
- **Problem**: whisperx requires specific numpy versions that conflict with other packages
- **Solution**: Commented out whisperx (not essential for core features)

### 4. **Version Constraints Too Strict**
- **Problem**: Exact version pinning causing conflicts
- **Solution**: Relaxed version constraints to use minimum compatible versions

## Files Modified

1. **requirements.txt** - Streamlined and made cloud-compatible
2. **runtime.txt** - Added Python 3.11.9 specification  
3. **packages.txt** - Added system dependencies for OpenCV/video processing
4. **main.py** - Added fallback config for missing config.yaml
5. **test_deployment.py** - Test script to verify dependencies

## Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Quick Deploy (Recommended)
```bash
# Push the fixed code to your GitHub repository
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Streamlit Cloud deployment dependencies"
git push origin main

# Redeploy on Streamlit Cloud - it should work now
```

### Option 2: Test Locally First
```bash
# Install the new requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Test the deployment script
python test_deployment.py

# Run locally to verify
streamlit run main.py
```

## Key Changes Made

### requirements.txt - Before vs After

**REMOVED (causing conflicts):**
- tf-keras>=2.19.0
- whisperx==3.4.2  
- Exact version pins for most packages

**ADDED/MODIFIED:**
- Relaxed version constraints
- numpy>=1.24.0,<2.0.0 (compatible with all packages)
- Removed non-essential dependencies

### New Files Created

1. **runtime.txt**
```
python-3.11.9
```

2. **packages.txt** (system dependencies)
```
libgl1-mesa-glx
libglib2.0-0
libsm6
libxext6
libxrender-dev
libgomp1
libgtk-3-0
libavcodec-extra
```

## Expected Result

The deployment should now:
✅ Resolve dependencies without conflicts  
✅ Use compatible Python version (3.11.9)  
✅ Install successfully on Streamlit Cloud  
✅ Start the app without infinite loops  
✅ Handle missing config.yaml gracefully  

## Monitoring Deployment

After pushing changes, monitor the Streamlit Cloud logs for:
1. ✅ Dependencies installing successfully
2. ✅ App starting up  
3. ✅ No import errors
4. ✅ UI loading properly

If you still see issues, the fallback config in main.py should prevent crashes and the app should start with basic functionality.

## Fallback Features

The app now includes:
- Default configuration if config.yaml is missing
- Graceful handling of missing optional dependencies  
- Core functionality preserved (video upload, basic analysis)
- Enhanced UI features maintained where possible

The deployment should complete successfully within 5-10 minutes instead of running infinitely.
